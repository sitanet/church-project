The word &ldquo;going&rdquo; in this scripture signifies that it is a present continuous term, we are going astray and it will require a journey to stop treading the path of going astray. As preaching is going on in this local assembly, people are still going astray. So, we all need shepherds to go back to God. You don&#39;t even have a sense of knowing how to go back without meeting a shepherd; if there are no shepherds, we will keep going astray until we can no longer be saved.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Immediately man fell in Genesis, there was a gap and the gap kept increasing. Adam left the garden but he was still around the garden; however, Cain journeyed far away from God. The reason shepherds are kept in place is because we have to go back to God. When I study the scriptures, I find something really interesting about shepherds.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">I am zeroing down the context to pastors of the local assembly. If you don&#39;t have a pastor, you are going nowhere; in the real sense, you have not started your Christian journey at all. There is nothing like: I am a Christian but I don&#39;t have a pastor, if you believe that, you are confused.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">The Lord Jesus who set them in the local assembly knows what He is doing.

What ought not to be hard becomes so difficult and hard. It is not that it is difficult in that sense, but you have taken a posture that makes it hard for you to be accessed by the shepherds. I now understand that all the friends of God in scriptures were shepherds; I believe that cannot be a coincidence. This is not to say that everyone should go get sheep and start rearing, but I understood that there is something about people that are around the sheep. There is a kind of heart they develop, I call it a shepherd&#39;s heart; it makes them close to God. Abel was a shepherd of the sheep and it did something to his heart such that he was enabled to do the will of God.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:250px; margin-right:257px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Genesis 4:2 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And she again bare his brother Abel.

This shows that there is something unique about shepherds that attracts heaven.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:250px; margin-right:257px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Luke 2:8 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"8\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:9px\">This is one of the duties of shepherds, they watch over your soul. Shepherds lead, feed and watch; they are watchmen that have oversight.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:263px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Luke 2:9-10 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"9\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:9px\">They were the first people that got the news. There is something about shepherds that we must not play with. When you play with shepherds that God sends, you are disconnecting yourself from God&rsquo;s allocation.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:259px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Psalms 78:70 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:259px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(70) He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">One of the attitudes you must take as sheep is that you do not play with feeding because this is the core assignment of shepherds. Fight anything that wants to stop you from feeding, for if you are not feeding, you are not receiving the shepherd. To receive a shepherd is to be fed by the shepherds. Shepherds are not saddled primarily with the responsibility of giving you prophetic words, they are meant to feed you with the word of God. How do you receive shepherds that the Lord sends to you? Make sure you prepare your heart to be fed.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:254px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Jeremiah 3:15 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:149px; margin-right:98px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(15) And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Don&#39;t play with feeding, that is one of the major works of a shepherd. If feeding is not important, Satan will not fight you concerning it. The blessing that Jesus gave your shepherd for you is your feeding, your food is with that man. When you get born again, one of the major things the Holy Ghost will want to do is to help you locate your shepherd. There are many people roaming in the Body without finding their own fold. A fold is like a battalion in military terms over whom a captain is set. It might be a group of 50 or 100 but they always have a leader or captain over them. In the military, all do not just go to war as they will, there is an order, they have captains over them. If you have not found a fold, you are a potential prey and what the Holy Ghost will do is to orchestrate your steps into your own fold for the work to start in you. The fact that you are in a church does not mean that you are part of a fold, a fold is a connection in the spiritual. Everyone in the fold is imprinted or inscribed on the heart of the shepherd.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"page-break-after:always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:266px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">John 10:14 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"14\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">There is a knowing that is spiritual, it is a connection in the heart. When you enter the flock, you enter the shepherd&rsquo;s heart. Anytime Satan wants to assault you, the shepherd will pick it because you are in the shepherd&rsquo;s heart. You should not just sit in church, you ought to sit in the heart of the shepherd. This is why when They want to increase an assembly, the heart of the shepherd will first be enlarged because the assembly has to be carried in his heart. If you are really connected to your shepherd, there is nothing about your life that your shepherd will not know about, and if he does not know, when he goes to God, he has the legal permission to get an answer concerning you. So, if you find a shepherd and you are well-submitted, you should not be confused; however, trusting that grace is the major problem. It is very easy to live as a Christian but Satan makes it difficult. Just trusting the people that Jesus has placed over you is all you need to journey successfully on this path. If you do that, you will not have any problem, your life will play out well. I have many first hand examples to this effect. I remember when I first came to church I was not trusting as I am now, and I know I still need to trust more. I was not trusting but was a bit sceptical. As a student, I used to travel from Ife to Lagos for meetings until I was connected to Daddy in Ibadan. When I came to see him in Ibadan, I had a lot of questions in my heart but I did not voice them out. However, as I listened to him talk, he picked each of those questions in my heart and answered them while we conversed; I did not tell him anything.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">When you come to an assembly and the words spoken are connected to you, it is not ordinary. Some of us have tried going to other churches, and we found out that what they were saying were in no way connected to us at all; it is because those people are not sent to you, that is not your fold. When you get born again, you must find your fold. If you do not find your fold, you will be exposed to evil.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:258px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">1 Peter 5:1-2 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:168px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:226px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">lucre, but of a ready mind;</span></em></h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">These people are shepherds being given instructions to feed the flock. The person that has oversight over you is the person feeding you. Issues concerning your life will be accurately attended to by the one that has oversight over you. Jesus does not give the oversight of a saint to many people, that is confusion, it is one man that oversees you per time. Some believers are not wise, the private issues of their life that should be handled by oversight are what they share with just anybody who advises them based on experience and not by grace; the Holy Ghost is not involved in such counsels.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">If you are well connected to the fold, your life will play out naturally. For instance, before my wife got pregnant, I sensed it because a thought came to my heart in that season but I got confirmation on one of those days I was talking with Daddy. He called me to his office and counselled me about what to do in that season. Also, concerning picking the date for my wedding, Daddy picked the appropriate date for us. Left to us, we would have made it a later date and we probably may not have been married till now because exactly two weeks after my wedding, the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown began. Your life is better and easier when you follow your shepherds; it is Satan that tells you to do otherwise because he is a wicked spirit that wants to isolate you from the fold. He knows it is difficult for him to reach you while you are in the fold because of the protection that is within the fold so he tries to bring you out.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">There is also warfare within the fold. There is warfare within the fold where sheep are gathered; there is always an attempt to cut the connection between the shepherd and the sheep. Satan wants to cut off that connection so that there is no flow anymore. He pushes you to a corner, where the word can no longer be accessible to you.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:257px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Hebrews 13:7 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:97px; margin-right:98px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(7) Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:216px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">the end of their conversation.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Your natural parents, as long as they are not teaching you the word, do not have this oversight over you.

It is not everyone that has rule over you. The associate pastors do not have rule over you, they are to support the ones (Daddy and Mummy) who have rule over you. That word &lsquo;rule&rsquo; is governmental, it shows that authority has been given. The people who stand in those offices do not even covet such positions because they understand that it requires a lot of sacrifice; it is death to them also.

Your goal should be one - eternal life, but you have many, that means you are scattered abroad. Your commitments are in different areas but when you meet a shepherd, he gathers you together and gives you a focus; anyone that is not doing that is against the Chief Shepherd. There are people in church that are against Him, they are scattering souls. Jesus Christ is not nice, sometimes if He passes judgement, it goes beyond you and can touch your children&#39;s children.

If you are a sheep and you are not as wise as a serpent, you will be eaten by wolves.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:256px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Romans 16:17 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:112px; margin-right:91px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(17) Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">learned; and avoid them.</span></em></h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Division is scattering.

We cannot screen everybody that comes to church, so you have the responsibility to keep yourself. Pastors also are walking in love and trusting that God will work on men so they cannot send some believers out of the church. If you attend teachings diligently, you will have wisdom. People are foolish because they don&#39;t attend to teachings. Teachings give enough wisdom to keep you, so all you need is to hear teaching very well. I wonder at how some believers behave. They hear something in church but go out to do otherwise.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Jesus knows that around New Testament teachings, all kinds of things are lurking at the corner. Pastor said that Satan is more interested in a New Testament gathering than in a club house. The Manchild company cannot be raised in a club house, it is demons that need to watch the people in club houses but spiritual wickedness, pricipalies, powers, fouls of the air, come to where the word of the kingdom is being taught. You must be wise, listen to the doctrine well and be careful. For some, what puts them into traps is their covetousness. Satan can use covetousness to trap you. Having an appetite that you have not allowed the Lord to tame can cause you to fall prey. You have to be content to keep yourself from things that defile. The Lord will help us, the Lord will give us wisdom. Don&#39;t try to do any shaddy thing without telling your Pastor, you&#39;re killing yourself that way. Daddy and Mummy are not children, they have spiritual expertise. If earthly organisations know how to commit important things to only skilled individuals, how much more God.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">Pst. Dimeji Elugbadebo</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">You don&#39;t need to be spared, if not, Satan will devour you. To devour a soul is to scatter a soul. When you are scattered, you have been devoured. There is an extent that you will be scattered to an extent that you cannot be restored again, where you cannot be reached by God anymore.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">There was a time in my life that I strayed and I suffered for it but God had mercy on me.

Acknowledge that you are being lost and come back under. I want to restore you. There is still grace for you to be restored, don&#39;t allow yourself to be fully devoured till I can no longer restore you. Don&#39;t go too far from my hand, for if my hand is stretched out to you and it cannot reach you, then you have gone far. I want to restore you. I am bringing help, receive it, don&rsquo;t think it is not you, receive it, I want to do a work of restoration, bringing many back under, under the shepherd&rsquo;s tents that I previously led them in.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">Message Continues</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">I know what it means to stray experientially. I think God allowed that so that I can value what it means to be a shepherd under Christ. You can still be receiving revelation even when you have strayed. There was a time that I was not paying tithe because I believed that I was the tithe; I suffered through those seasons. There is no way you will go through that and you will not be thorough. Some believe that we do not know what you are doing, we know; we are just praying for you and in some other cases, we want you to learn from your experience; some need to learn that way so that the lesson can stick better.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Pastor Friday really blessed us today. I was wondering how he got those scriptures from the Old Testament; I never saw those scriptures that way. If you see anyone that does not like pastors, they have an Egyptian soul.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Souls need to be domesticated by truth. When you compare a domesticated cat and a wild cat, the wild cat is very fierce like a lion.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Many believers are wild, and there are ministers like that; they have gifts but they are wild. If you are streaming their messages, they will deal with you. There are some apostles that talk down on church. You will be listening to them and your understanding of the new testament will drop. I know major apostles in Nigeria that talk against the church; those are not true apostles. No New Testament apostle will hate church. One of the signs that you took milk well is that you will love church and love pastors. If someone does not grow well in a family, it will show but when someone grows up well in a good family, there is a way they are structured. Church work is a holistic work, it is well structured; if there are things you lacked while growing up in your natural family, you can get it in Church.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">You will grow if you are under. Growth is very natural, it is an organic process that should happen to you naturally. If anyone is stuck and not growing, that means they are not believing. Unbelief is attached to spiritual age; it is natural to children. If a soul is not believing, it is because they have lost the posture of a sheep. If you have stopped feeding amongst the flock, you will not grow.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">The grace of Jesus rests on pastors, so if your pastors are preaching, you must hear Jesus. If you are in a church and you are hearing Jesus, go to where you can hear Jesus. You must hear the voice of Jesus in your shepherd. Many believers do not even know the voice of Jesus.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">We do a lot of work to make sure that you understand this.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:256px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Matthew 9:36 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:105px; margin-right:98px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(36) But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Pastoral work must take a certain kind of shape. It is possible that a church has multitudes but does not have pastoral structure. The bigger a church grows, the smaller it should be. If we have a ten thousand congregation, we must have stronger pastoral units, that is the only way you can account for them. God is not against numbers but there must be structure that can cater for people pastorally. Heaven does not judge the quality of a church by the number of people there but by how the saints there are being attended to and cared for.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">When you faint, it means you are not eating. You will not eat when there is food because of lack of appetite and what causes that is sickness. You can be well-dressed, wearing jeans, a tie, and perfumes but your soul is sick. When you are not feeding, over time, it will show.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">At times, you can escape pastoral radar. God was teaching me that there are some souls that can camouflage, they have learnt the stealth way in the spirit. You can be hypocritical or pretentious but we will catch you very soon or you will be exposed. It is good for you to be exposed.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">While growing up, anytime I wanted to do something wrong, I was always caught so I did not have the mind to engage in them. It is a good prayer to pray, that if you want to do any wrong thing, God should ensure that you are caught. When you keep escaping being caught, your heart becomes more hardened.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">You will faint if you are not feeding and you will be scattered abroad. Be very careful. We have six pastors in this local assembly so if you go and get counsel from another person who is not a pastor, you are on your own. If you counsel somebody and because of your counsel, that soul dies, God will take the blood of that soul from you. If you do not repent, Jesus will judge you. Some people have killed many souls through wrong counsels.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">We think we know what church is, even before we got born again. Many people who are being called pastors are not pastors; they are just bearing the title. The Nigerian church has gone through the feast of Jeroboam, where many that are not called are being ordained. The title is so cheap, that is why the quality is so low. They have spoiled the pastoral ministry so much that you have lost respect for it and you think all pastors are the same. All pastors are not the same, Jesus Christ has original pastors that He have been sent by to cater for the flock, to feed them well.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Many grew up in churches where they have been abused and Satan did all those things so that he could raise examples in the church. He has dealt with many and raised the wrong standard in the church such that the Church has become a ridicule to the world. Church will call a meeting these days and people will come late, yet they will not tremble. We don&#39;t know what the Church is. I grew up in a church where people run when they come late to church. It is because the standard has gone down that is why all manner of things are being experienced in the church. People don&#39;t know what the church is or who pastors are. The church has rule, it has government; it is not just any kind of institution. What is happening in the Nigerian church today is akin to what is recorded in the Bible - the feasts of Jeroboam where he ordained everybody as priests so that Israelites would not go back to Jerusalem. The Nigerian church has misrepresented pastoring. The pastoral responsibility is a heavenly grave responsibility, the fact that you will account before Jesus is a serious thing.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:254px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Jeremiah 23:1 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Pastors can scatter the sheep by wrong doctrine. People are not interested in God, they are interested in money. There was a time the Nigerian church was interested in going to heaven but these days, believers are not even interested again. That is why messages are being coined around kingdom riches and being kingdom billionaires. If you need money, you don&#39;t need God to be a billionaire. The Church should not be subject to money, the power and authority in Church makes money serve us. An unbeliever can make all the money and come and drop it in church; power can rest on him to release it. The ministry of the church is to shepherd souls and bring them to Jesus. It is low for a pastor to sit on the seat of the presidency; that is a low throne. If I have to leave the pulpit to go and contest for local government counsellor, I am going for a lower assignment. There are so many misconceptions about the Church today.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:254px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Jeremiah 23:2 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and</span></em><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">This is judgement against false pastoral ministry. This is not to drive people away from church, it is driving people away from God. Many believers go for digital, packaged churches, and fine pastors; that cannot deal with the soul. You need unrefined, very crude anointing to deal with the soul of men. This is going to happen to the Nigerian church, it is happening already, it is happening in America and spreading fast to other nations.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:254px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Jeremiah 23:3 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:164px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">You cannot be fruitful and increase without a fold. If you say you are part of the Body and you are not part of a fold, you are confused. Even if you are a minister, that does not mean you should not have a fold. As an itinerary minister for instance, you should have a home, a church base. Apostle Paul had a church he was reporting to, so why should you not have one? He had pastors, he had people that could talk to him.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:254px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Jeremiah 23:4 KJ</span></em></h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And I will set up shepherds over them which shall them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:225px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">be lacking, saith the LORD.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">When you are afraid, you are not feeding. If you are afraid of everything, afraid of your future, dominated by fear,it is because you are not feeding. To be dismayed means that you are confused. Prosperity, both of the soul and in the natural is attached to feeding. There is nobody hearing sound doctrine that will be poor. It will show in your purse over time, just wait. Sometimes, heaven can make your disobedience affect your purse so that They can get your attention. Some believers can live in disobedience for a long time without feeling it, they have not been praying, they will allow their finances to be touched to get their attention. If they don&rsquo;t respond or yield to this operation, the next thing they will do is to allow your body to be touched. Some people are down with health challenges because of their unwillingness to respond to God.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Lord will help us, our soul will be restored in Jesus name.</h3>", "created_date": "2022-07-03T01:56:30Z"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 9, "fields": {"blog_title": "Why We Need Pastors", "minister_name": "Pst.

Whatever the Lord brings, is for His people and if we say we are a remnant, we are still a people. With God, the meaning of remnant is not a small company of men, as we think, when God says a remnant, He is seeing billions of people out of the earth. God does not supply grace for you to be alone, it is so that you can be with people.

The Greek word for pastor is <em>&lsquo;poimen&rsquo;</em>. The noun of the word pastor is shepherd while the verb of that word is to feed, that is why we can say that pastors are shepherds that feed. As a believer, your mind can be fed but your soul is not being fed. You can go into a place where sensual things that motivate the mind towards pursuing the world are being taught but the soul is not being fed. That is not true feeding, you are just being polluted. They are men that want to spoil you who bring sensual things to spoil you.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:255px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Colossians 2:8 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:110px; margin-right:102px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(8) Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">world, and not after Christ.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Some are coming to this church but are feeding from somewhere else. The messages you listen to on your phone are an indication of where you are feeding from. That is why many are not straight but are warped, their construction is not thorough. When you are drawing from different sources, you will be confused. There are many things that will pollute your water and when God comes to you, He cannot brood. When God comes to us, He wants to meet a still water; we have to be still for Him to come to us.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">Interpretation of Tongues</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">I am showing you, I am teaching you, restoring My government over your soul, for your soul to be governed by wisdom.

For there is a hunter who hunts souls, who knows how to pastor souls by giving them another sense of direction, by another government, but I want to restore you under My own government where you can be pastored well by the pastoral grace that is in your Lord which He also puts in men. I want to teach you so that you can run away from the wicked hunter, so that you can turn to Me who is your great shepherd.

It is not like it is not good to admire and covet the grace of people that have power, God gave them those gifts but those things are not enough to build up your soul. We must all understand and agree with that. When I was growing up in the faith, I used to struggle when I read the Bible and saw that Jesus did not do any miracle until He was 30. I</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">thought that as powerful as He is, it is not possible that He did not do any miracle before the wedding at Canaan. I just told myself, they were probably not recorded but with the coming of everlasting light, I now understand that there was a reason God shut down that area of Jesus&rsquo; life. It was not that Jesus did not have power, God just put the focus on His growth. If the average believer has the kind of power Jesus has, they would not do natural things themselves again. At times, God would not permit those gifts to be revealed because He knows we will use it for ourselves. They want to deal with selfish tendencies in our souls. Every gift that God gives is not for you, when you convert it to your personal use, you are becoming a Satan; gifts are not meant to be consumed on your lust.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:107px; margin-right:114px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;James 4:3 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">It is mercy when you ask and you do not receive because if you receive, you will destroy yourself and even the rest of God&rsquo;s population on the earth.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Gifts do not build souls. God does not want to raise people without virtue; men who have so much manifestation but when it comes to long suffering, they are lacking. Many times, many say they want the power of Elijah but all they want to do with it is to expend it on themselves. Why did God give Elijah power, it was to turn Israel back to God, to redeem Israel and not for him to show off. He was meant to use it to judge the prophets of Baal. When you are asking for power, examine your motive for asking for that power. True power and all the power that you need is in Christ. The scripture says that Christ has been made to us the wisdom and the power of God so if you want power, ask for Christ. Let Him turn you from mortality to immortality, let Him build you up from within; that is true power.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">The real reason many believers want power is because they want to vaunt themselves. If you want to have power gifts, you can go on a fast for ninety days for instance. I know a friend who used to do that and he had three church branches in Ukraine before the war but when we talk about having spiritual virtues, they are scarce in the lives of many whose focus is only on gifts. There are so many things God wants to build in you and when you are coming to God, you will have to drop power. What God seeks for is virtues, substances, image and glory, this is why They give us pastors who can teach us these things. So, when your pastors come to teach you, don&#39;t get angry and believe they do not want you to &lsquo;blow&rsquo;. You cannot be allowed to&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">become influential after Satan&rsquo;s order in this path, if you go that way, it will be impossible to find you in God again. When Jesus called His disciples, He called them to make them, not to &lsquo;announce them&rsquo;. Church is for making, so we must love making; those who God will call must be made.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">There are many things we do ignorantly thinking we are pleasing God but He is not pleased. The wrought of man does not work the righteousness of God, just receive with meekness the engrafted word of God that can save your soul. If you are not doing that, you are not walking purposefully. We have a very short time on this path of life, and as God has set us under shepherds to receive feeding, stay there and learn all you need to know. God knows the time every man has, so we need to submit to His work in us. There are works that prevent many from submitting to the shepherds God has set over them so, instead of them being built up in the duration of time God has set, their building is being delayed.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Joseph was also a shepherd, he was shepherding Jesus. We do not know so many things about Joseph, but I believe he was a man of stature, that was why heaven could entrust so much to him. I believe that in the world to come, he would be a man of honour. Like Joseph, we should be men who are not seeking to be known but doing the work of God with all diligence.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">If the Lord knows that it will take twenty years for your process to come into Christ to be completed, He will place you somewhere where you will be fed in order to come to that point. For some of us, because of friends, perspectives, it takes longer for the work in us to be done; many do not even align at all. God has His own curriculum, just as we have curriculum in schools; God&rsquo;s curriculum are the mysteries of Christ, the Father and God. For instance, if you are meant to do a course in each aspect of that curriculum for three months but you fail to submit yourself to the shepherd who is meant to teach you, you can stay at that point for as long as ten years. The Israelites were meant to journey to the promised land in 40 days but it took them 40 years. Moses was a shepherd and God had to train him for forty years so that he could lead His people. Israel was just meant to follow Moses so that they could come to God. Moses used to go to the mountain and he did not die, but they refused to follow him, which means that they did not believe in Moses, so they could not come into God.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jeremiah 23:4 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they</span></em>&nbsp;<em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">be lacking, saith the LORD.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">Shepherds or pastors are to feed the flock.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:254px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Jeremiah 3:15 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:149px; margin-right:102px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(15) And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">The primary work of pastors is to feed us with knowledge and understanding.

This is why the apostle Paul says: we are crushed but not defeated. They go through a lot for our sake, these men cry as they go planting their seeds (<strong>Scripture</strong>), but their joy is in the harvest. So, if you are not bringing forth fruit, if you are not growing, you are bringing more pain to them. You do not have to see your pastors crying physically, but they really go through a lot of pain. Many believers are self absorbed, so they feel Pastors should give them attention, but they do not understand the measure of burden they carry. The work itself is enormous and our responsibility as believers is to see to it that we journey by growing up. Our growth is what makes them sing as they return from the harvest.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:107px; margin-right:114px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Luke 13:7 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t\t<ol start=\"5\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none:</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ol>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:173px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">When God gives seed, He gives it to the sower, and when it is planted, He does not go directly to the seed to take account but He goes to the vinedresser for that.

However, our focus here is on the ministry the apostles gave themselves to - the ministry of the word and prayer. The Bible is precise, it did not order it differently, the right way is word and prayer, not prayer and ministry of the word. We are all meant to pray, prayer is a continuous activity that we must give ourselves to as believers but the paramount calling that will cause us to grow up is the ministry of the word. When you join this local church for instance and ask why we spend so much time teaching the word, it is because we understand the importance of the ministry of the word. Prayer is not a ministry, so if you say God has called you into the intercessory ministry, you are yet to know what your ministry truly is. You can have more grace to pray but while you pray, pay attention to your feeding. Prayer is like water while the word is like food or bread; you need bread for your survival. If you constantly drink water without eating, you will be malnourished; it may even lead to death because all the nutrients the body needs to grow are not present. There was a time the Israelites did not have water in the wilderness for instance, but they were constantly being fed with manna daily. This is not to play down on prayer, prayer is important, we should pray, but the word is much more important. You ate a kind of food which made you the way you are (carnal man) but you must also eat another kind of food to be changed. The ministry of the word must be exalted. In schools for instance, teaching raises men to become professionals in their fields and in this order also, there is a ministry we must be taught to become.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:267px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Acts 20:32 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:111px; margin-right:98px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(32) And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:111px; margin-right:98px\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:111px; margin-right:98px\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:111px; margin-right:98px\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:111px; margin-right:98px\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">If you are not being built up, there is no inheritance.

The template for building the kingdom of God is in the scriptures. The major concern of our parents is that you do not grow wrongly. Sometimes, when you are relating with materials, you have to be careful because spirits latch on those things. Don&rsquo;t be lured by your lusts, stay within boundaries. Out of care, your pastors tell you not to fellowship with things that can pollute you but when you don&#39;t trust their judgment, you think they are just being overbearing.

God is still in the process of setting the solitary in families and He sets men over the church.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">God has a system of order, it is through that system that souls are attended to and they grow up. Your desire should be to grow up; it is abnormal for a believer to desire that God should use him or give him power. That is the real abnormal, even though we have been used to it, it is still not the right order.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">People that minister in the New Testament church are put under chains, it is the sovereign will of God that makes them that way; it is not an ambition. The reason people have an ambition is because of the gain they desire, if you wield an ambition around ministry, you don&#39;t know what ministry is.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">In today&rsquo;s teaching, I saw the system of church governance that was in the early church; it was so strong. When we were much younger in the faith, we did not understand this. The New Testament church is very governmental; church is not fellowship. When I wanted to start church, Reverend Kayode said I should call it church and not fellowship. We were looking for less offensive names to use to tag the work because we did not want people to be afraid; using the word fellowship is less offensive than using church. The church is governmental; the atmosphere of the New Testament church is very governmental and God is restoring this order back.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:107px; margin-right:114px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">2 Corinthians 8:22 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"page-break-after:always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<ol start=\"22\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:130px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">In choosing men who would work with the apostles, those who had gifts were not considered but men who were faithful servants were selected. They had no regard for anyone, all they chose were proved. All the people that worked with Paul were serving with churches. They travelled with Paul and in seasons where they are not working, go back to their churches. Not just any kind of man was presented to Paul, only men everyone loved and knew had hearts of service. That&rsquo;s how he picked men for apostolic work; Paul did not just pick anointed or gifted men, he picked people who had character. Why? If you are working with an apostle and you are well submitted, in a few months, his grace can rest on you. That anointing is not really your own but is being given by the Lord. God can anoint an apostolic personality, raise a team around him and put measures of anointing on them. God can take from that anointing that is on a man and anoint others to fill in the work for that same apostolic flow. God is a very orderly person, so if you are working with a minister, you must understand that you are not apart from the grace, you are just a compliment to the grace.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:241px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">2 Corinthians 8:23 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"23\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of,</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:99px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:241px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">1 Corinthians 11:3 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:105px; margin-right:102px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(3) But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:271px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Christ is God.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">It means that Jesus understands the concept of covering very well. Pastors carry the covering of Christ; that office has been attacked severally. If you are not under pastors God has placed over you, you are not under His covering. Many believers are not accounted for, they are just roaming about in the church. Some are even doing ministry that God did not send them to do. Many set up a church just because they have an idea but in the New Testament, because you are gifted, it does not mean you have to start something.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"page-break-after:always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Not everybody is sent to you, only your pastors are sent to you.

The pastoral ministry is for feeding, it is not for titles. In a church today, there can be several pastors, sometimes even more than the members and many of them do not even have a clue concerning feeding the saints.</h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">We will still look deeper into all these things and how it all works. Copastors work along with pastors, it is a team. Copastors cannot just bring out their own message, the Lord will only cast direction through the senior pastor of the church.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">In a church, when we are emphasising on feeding and you are not eating well, you are a rebellious sheep and that is where the rod and staff comes in. When other flocks are feeding and one sheep goes astray, the shepherd leaves the other sheep and goes to look for the lost sheep. It means that sheep has strayed away from the normal grazing route and when it is seen, the rod is used to break the leg of such a sheep. Some sheep stray away totally, so the shepherd&rsquo;s staff which is u-shaped is used to bring them back into alignment. The work of a shepherd is not easy.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:9px\">Some people have to be broken so that they can be brought back to the fold. At times, sheep think they are wise and know what to eat.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:9px\">I have a pastor, Reverend Kayode Oyegoke is my Pastor and there are things I get as instruction from him.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3>Body ministries sent to equip ministers, pastors, and the flock. For example, Eternal Glorious Fountain Ministry (EGFM) is raised to equip ministers and churches in the Body. However, you cannot be feeding from a ministry and not have a local church. Reverend Kayode is an apostle sent to churches; he is sent to pastors but you need to be under pastors in an assembly. That is why Pastor Emeka, Pastor Thompson and also other pastors have churches around these waters so that believers can be a part of a local assembly. You cannot be listening to the word online and you are not gathered onsite, if you are in this category, it should be for a season, not a constant occurrence.

If you trust us as your pastors, you should let us know when you want to read some materials; either books or messages. I recommend books from the pulpit and you can even ask pastors about the materials you want to read. You can read some materials or listen to messages that can injure you. For instance, some ministers make saints prayer machines but your growth as a believer is tied to feeding; fasting and praying outside feeding will not help you. You will not grow but will only be a spiritist. When people still have sin but are desiring power, they fall under the anointing and are excited, yet they are still not growing spiritually.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">In the New Testament, there are important things we must give attention to for growth, not just engaging in spiritual exercises in vain. If you see praying for 72 hours as more important than sitting down to learn, you are roaming around the Body. You do not really have power if you cannot sit down to take sound doctrine. You have not listened to your unit head and you want to hear the voice of the Head of the church; that is not possible. The first time Samuel heard the voice of the Lord, it was through Eli&#39;s voice. If Samuel was not under authority, he would not have been able to hear God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:111px; margin-right:98px\">There are many hirelings in the body that God did not send, their gifts sent them.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "created_date": "2022-07-17T02:32:15Z"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 10, "fields": {"blog_title": "Why We Need Pastors Pt.2", "minister_name": "Pst.

But the shepherdic grace supplies the area of &lsquo;what to do&rsquo;.

Eternal life is the gift of God, so Jesus, the Head takes over. So we have to use the knowledge of the will to grow well into the Head. Anything that the shepherdic grace supplies to us is for us to keep growing and not want.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:256px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Psalms 23:2-3 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name&#39;s sake.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">All these stages are for you to come to your rest.

I was in a particular local church before and I was doing well. I went to convention</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">because I already knew about Reverend Kayode Oyegoke since school. As I was hearing the teachings, I was just wondering that if I got back to Ibadan, how would I be able to get access to this kind of teaching. As though the Lord heard me, almost immediately, Reverend Kayode called all the pastors in EGFM who pastored local churches and he was mentioning the cities their churches were located. He told us Pastor Dimeji was in Ibadan and asked those of us in Ibadan to meet with him. So, after the meeting, Pastor wrote down our names and said he would get back to us later. When I got back to Ibadan, I told my mum that I wanted to change my church, she asked why and I told her that I just want to get nurtured. There were several challenges that came from that angle but I thank God that I did not recede on my decision to join church. The following week after convention, daddy called to inform me of when service would be held, so I came and I remember I initially wanted to sit near where nursing mothers sit but mummy told me not to sit there but go sit at the front. Pastor taught that day about the parable of the sower.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">I was serving in Ibadan then and many job opportunities outside the city kept opening up so I had reasons to leave and pursue them. One of them was in Osogbo and the offer included an official car and a house but I just stayed and was content playing the keyboard. I did not really stay because I was playing the keyboard but I saw a grace that I knew was for the building up of my soul.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:260px; margin-right:267px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Acts 20:32 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"32\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:152px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">What shepherds feed with is the word of His grace.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">There were many oppositions to my staying in Ibadan. I remember I got another job opportunity which I told Pastor about and he said I could go, maybe he was considering the fact that I needed that job to meet my natural needs but I knew I was not supposed to. The next Sunday, Pastor preached a message that made it clear to me that I was to stay. Eventually I started a job under the guidance of Daddy, stopped that, and joined another one. What I am doing right now was also by guidance.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">At the beginning of this journey, I could not see the end of the path. I did not know where it would land me. If I had left against God&rsquo;s instruction, maybe by now, I would have died.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">After a long season of contentions, jobs started coming in. Not like I got a large number but it was enough for my sustenance. However, spiritual meals and bread were constant. My wife and son came as a result of my staying under them.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">I remember a brother in the faith called me to come to Lagos at that time because my job has better prospects in Lagos but I had to be discerning. Thank God for grace to stay, I know I have evolved over time. Prophetic worship was so strong in the house then and that is how I got the prophetic grace I have now. I had to unlearn certain things in order to cleave well. Grace addresses everything in my life, it pays to stay under shepherdic tent.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:441px\">Closing Exhortation Pastor Dimeji Elugbadebo</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\"><strong>Exhortation on Tongues</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">These tongues are witnessing to the message so that the heart can believe. It is not easy to convince the heart. What convinces the heart of doctrine is not miracles; miracles are to convince unbelievers but when it comes to convincing the heart to believe doctrine, it is prophecy that does that work. When doctrine comes and prophecy follows, it is not cunningly-devised fables, it is to help the heart pay attention to what was said.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">Interpretation of Tongues</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">I show a pattern, I show you a pattern, a pattern.

I did not even know you were going through all you spoke about but I thank God that you yielded to God because it was God using you. You could have chosen to go to New and Living Way Church and I would have allowed you but that might not be what God wants for you.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">It is possible to join yourself to a New Testament living church but if that is not where God wills for you to be, God might reach you there but you will find out that there is a place that you may not be able to have in the Spirit. These are difficult things to say but it is the truth. At times when you disobey God, in a way, you know deep down in your spirit that you are doing what you should not do but when the heart is weak, we seek options. It is possible you know that if you do something, you will die, so you begin to look for options close to that and by so doing, you are not pleasing God totally. That is why Christianity is the way it is, men are coming up with options for themselves as alternatives to obeying God. Doing what you know is not entirely God&rsquo;s will, that is still Saul.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Under the atmosphere of the word, you get clear directions. When I counsel people sometimes, I know if they have heard God or not. Most times, I ask them what God has said and as they speak, I am able to perceive if God has spoken to them. With many, I know they have not heard from God so to be sure, I just tell them that we should wait on it. That is the point many many have problems with me because I can wait for two years with you on a matter. Papa Hagin said that it is better to be late in doing the will of God than to go ahead of God; it is better you are the one catching up with God.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Even if Pastor Siji lost job opportunities, what is a job compared to eternal inheritance? God can bring an industry to Ibadan just because of one person. So, that is not the first thing I think about, I first consider the purpose of God, salvation of a soul and spiritual growth.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:9px\">It is not easy to be a New Testament pastor because you will offend many people. I have offended many people, not because I want to, I am naturally not an offensive</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">person, but I have offended many because of my stand with the truth. When you tell people to do things God&rsquo;s way, that&rsquo;s when you begin to see reactions because people already have personal plans. Such people begin to look for alternatives and part of that is looking for alternative counsels. This is why I do not pastor souls in other churches - even souls in sister-ministries. I do not do internet pastoring, even basic answering questions. I know a brother in Lagos that I told to go and meet Pastor Thompson. He wanted to keep following our teachings but I told him that since he knows God has not led him to Ibadan, he should go to Pastor Thompson in Lagos.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">We are not trying to limit you. Some of you think that we do not want you to go abroad, go there and you will understand like the prodigal son did. If I tell you to wait and allow us to check certain decisions again, it is because I am trying to do my job as a pastor. It is better to delay now than to rush into certain things. The same principle applies in the area of marriage; when I tell you to wait, it is for your good. Why will you rush something now, and five years down the line, you will regret it? Something that could have been settled if you just waited a bit. However, the truth is that a large portion of the flock are children; they are ignorant so they find it difficult to believe.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">We should all be children, but not the ignorant ones, rather, we should be children in that we are able to follow. Even as a Pastor, I am a child; I have men that I follow. There are certain decisions I cannot take on my own; I know if I take them without counsel, I will get into trouble.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">All the fivefold are shepherdic but pastors and bishops are the closest to the flock.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:256px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">1 Timothy 3:1 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">A bishop should work with a pastor, they form a pastoral team with the lead pastor. For instance, Timothy was a pastor under Paul. The lead pastor has a pioneering grace. Timothy had the responsibility to select his own bishops under the Holy Ghost but Paul had to tell him the criteria of selecting bishops. It is an office under the pastoral office, Reverend Kayode Oyegoke will say bishop means by shop, that is, they stay by the shop (souls).</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">The Bible also has a definition for elders, they are not simply church members that are old like we believe today in the church. We should honour men that are old in church of course but that does not make them elders. We can have older brethren in church that have wisdom but are not bishops or pastors, although they can also help the pastoral team. Where God is taking us is that our churches will be a church of elders. As a believer, you may be an elder yet never have a role in quote but you have a place. By the time we reach the book of third John, we see more of elders; those elders are those that have grown with God for years. The elders mentioned in Acts 15:2 were the saints that got born again in Acts 2, so if you grow well, you will become an elder. Everybody should be an elder. Who are elders? Elders are fathers God can have a covenant with.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Some people are so fixated on having titles in church but I am particular about believers having stature. The people that judge growth by the quantity of membership of a church don&rsquo;t know what church really is. The best thing that can happen to you as a believer is to be a member; the highest title in the church is brother, it is higher than the title of an apostle. It is ignorance that stops us from knowing these things. To be a floor member in a progressive New Testament church is a blessing; just being there, learning and growing and loving the brethren.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">That is why someone will join a church and is doing IT. This church started in 2013, if we are not teaching with the New Testament standard, we may have had at least four branches. If you know the number of people that have come and left this church, you will be amazed; they would have stayed if the standard was lower. When you come to this local assembly, once you stay for a while, you will understand that you must be ready to pay the price to stay in this kind of assembly, so you will have to ask yourself if you are ready to pay the price. I would rather have us few than to be a large number of people without a standard.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">We do believe in sending ministries, it is just that the standard has to be high. I will not put my hand publicly on you and commission you into ministry if you are not a faithful son in the house. Some people have demanded that I release them and when I check my spirit and ask God for permission, in most cases, He says no, He did not send them. In such situations, sometimes, I just pray for them but not publicly. If I will pray over you publicly, it must be because you are faithful son under the watchful eyes of our General Overseer, Jesus.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">I remember that someone close to Daddy Oyegoke left and started his ministry; Daddy prayed for him but not publicly because he was not meant to leave. Before Pastor Thompson started Loveseal Church, he waited for years. It was as though Daddy Oyegoke had forgotten him. Even the day he was eventually prayed for, he was not expecting it; that is how it is done.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">I believe in sendings but in a true apostolic order. I believe in both pioneering and extensive ministries. One of the things that is happening to this emerging kingdom order is that God is reducing unnecessary breakages. There is a pioneering grace, you must wait to get it before you start any church. God might put grace on you to pioneer a church that is not an extension of a former church. This is akin to what Pastor Thompson is doing. He was under Pastor Emeka who was serving under Daddy and they sensed that he had grace to begin a new pioneering work which was still the same work but with a different identity. God put it in his spirit but it was confirmed also; the leading of the Spirit is very detailed.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">There was a time when New and Living Way Church (NLWC) sent one particular brother to pastor a branch of NLWC but he was angry and left because he said if he could be considered to pastor a branch of NLWC, why could he not have his own church. What he did not understand was that he should not even have considered having his own; it is a wrong attitude. He was thinking of having an empire, he did not understand that there are specificities and details in these things.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Most times, it is safe when you are under. Pastor Emeka often says that his ministry is an appendage to EGFM, that is wisdom. I believe that is what God called him uniquely to do and he has been faithful at it. May we all be found faithful. I believe in sending, and I know that this is an area where we often get attacked but it has to be done according to order. I do not believe in sending people anyhow. In the church today, we do all kinds of things and we do not even understand the ordinations of the New Testament. In fact, some believers select their fathers and they often select weak fathers who cannot instruct them.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">I can never be bigger than Daddy Oyegoke no matter how well this church grows. Bishop Oyedepo is not bigger than Papa Hagin even though Winners is way bigger physically than Rhema; having a big ministry is not by the size.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">No believer should compel a minister to lay hands on them, that is witchcraft. If you eventually get hands laid on you that way, nothing will go with you. When Daddy Oyegoke laid hands on me, I know something left from him to me. That is the kind of sending I want, I do not want to start any work with no power backing me up. Spiritual gifts can finish anytime so you have to go forth with more than that.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">The pastoral office with bishops is the closest to the saints and it is the least discerned and easy for saints to despise. Naturally, it is easy not to regard someone you see every time but to like the one that comes once in a while. I remember a pastor friend who invited a female guest minister to his church. When she finished, many of the members of that church were so wowed that many of them went to meet that minister after the service and said they wanted to submit to her. The wife of the host pastor is a very anointed minister who had been working on the saints but because she was always with them, they despised her. That is how children behave. Naturally, children can like neighbours more than their parents. A pastor can be close to you and has all that you need but you will not see it nor appreciate it. Grace can be passing through him everyday, yet you are not seeing it. This is why we are teaching these things so that you can discern the pastoral grace and cleave well.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">A local church under the authority of the pastor should also work with ministry gifts. There are ministry gifts we bring as the Lord permits to this local assembly and they bless us when they come. It is not any minister that can work with a church at a level. We cannot just bring anybody here because they are popular in the church, that does not mean they know the work we are doing here. Work in churches is at different levels, so, when we bring certain ministers here, all of us combined make up the five-fold.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">You do not need any other thing outside the ones we perceive should be brought in a season. A minister may not know what we are building here, so he will just come and say things that will scatter the work. Pastors of local churches need to work with ministers that can discern the work in their assembly. Someone can be an apostle of milk but he cannot discern a meat or strong meat church; he cannot bless such works. When ministers that I work together with as a team in a larger context come here to preach, I do not need to balance their message. I am saying this because some of you have questions concerning this; we cannot bring any and everyone to this pulpit. I want us to appreciate the flow of grace the Lord has provided for us.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "created_date": "2022-07-24T03:14:37Z"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 11, "fields": {"blog_title": "The Shepherd's Tent (Ethics Governing New Testament Church Life) Pt.2", "minister_name": "Pst Friday Yusufu", "address_location": "120, Ajibode Ojoo Ibadan oyo state", "category": "BS", "blog_photo_1": "photos/22/08/14/bible_study_CRDO31b.jpg", "blog_photo_2": "photos/22/08/14/bible_study_quFXKpy.jpg", "blog_photo_3": "photos/22/08/14/bible_study_V6AYmPo.jpg", "blog_photo_4": "photos/22/08/14/bible_study_4uKlIw7.jpg", "blog_photo_5": "photos/22/08/14/bible_study_vvlK4g0.jpg", "blog_body": "<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">Interpretation of Tongues</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Open to you this morning, open to you again this morning is that access you always enjoy.

There are ethics governing the New Testament church life as pertaining to Her relationship with the Shepherd. There are ethics and those ethics are not there for &#39;control sake&#39;, they were put there so that the flock or the sheep can draw blessings from the Shepherd. Jesus is the Chief Shepherd in the New Testament church, but we can see that Jesus puts men in place under His shepherdic oversight. We need to understand this because there are doctrines being peddled around that are against the order Jesus has put in place. For instance, some people say they are under Jesus and not under any man, they make statements such as: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t call any man my father&rsquo;. These thoughts are not accurate; in the New Testament church, pastors are positioned as overseers and epistles written to believers in the context of a church.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:9px\">Jesus as the Chief Shepherd puts men in place and there is no way you can bypass those men to have access to Him (Jesus). I pray that this will become a common understanding in the Body of Christ. If you don&rsquo;t have pastors over you, you can&rsquo;t progress. There is no way you can contend with the forces fighting the churches in</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">this age without an oversight God has placed over you. If Satan is after your family and you don&rsquo;t have pastors, you are in trouble because you cannot wage that war yourself; you don&#39;t know what it takes to fight spirits. Spirits can tear a family apart because they are not under covering or alignment. Fundamentally, angels are regimented and they understand order very well, including fallen angels; they know order and can see whether you are under or not. They know when you are outside alignment and they harness that premise to attack you. Fallen spirits try to dislodge many believers from alignment. To be in alignment means that when heaven looks at you from above, they see an order - our Lord Jesus is under the Father, the pastor is under the Lord, and you are under the pastor They have placed you under. If you are not under anyone who is under God, when you are traced and you are not found aligning, you are on your own.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Angelic spirits understand order; they know those that are under authority; under shepherds with our Lord Jesus as the Chief Shepherd.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:265px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">1 Peter 5:1 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:168px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">All of them were not elders, few were elders amongst them.

An elder is not what you become because you have been in church for long and the pastor likes you; you can be an elder like that for administrative purposes but not in line with what Peter was saying here.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:258px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">1 Peter 5:2-3 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:226px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">lucre, but of a ready mind;</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Neither as being lords over God&#39;s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">The primary assignment of true shepherds is to feed and oversee the flock; no one should do it for gain because the people, the flock are actually God&#39;s heritage. This is why a shepherd should be an example to the flock.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:262px; margin-right:269px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">1 Peter 5:4 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">If He is the Chief Shepherd, then it means there are others under Him. Gabriel called Michael the Chief Prince which means that there are other princes under him. The Lord Jesus is called the Chief Shepherd, it means there are shepherds under Him and He will reward those that are shepherding under Him. They are working under Him, but He is the Chief under the Father. He comes to check what they are doing, and strengthen their work from time to time. That is why as a flock, you do not have the right to correct your pastor because you are not the Chief over him, Jesus is the Chief over him. You don&#39;t have the right to speak against a man that Jesus puts in place. For instance, in medical line, as a patient, if you are being treated by a doctor and while he is administering your treatment, the chief consultant comes in, you can seek to speak with him directly. However, when you are done speaking, he will turn to the resident doctor to hear what he has to say and it is what he says that determines what he will use; not your suggestion because the doctor has been trained for years. Jesus has trained and raised men whom he has put in place as shepherds, yours is to make sure that you are in alignment to receive from them.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">In a local assembly, we are used to the word &lsquo;pastor&rsquo; which is also correct but the word pastor and shepherd have the same meaning in Greek.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Shepherds are very key to the salvation plan. Removing the pastoral ministry from the Body will make it very difficult for salvation to reach the saints; that ministry is highly needed for salvation. The pastoral ministry is highly needed, other ministries in the Body can have temporal contact with the saints but the pastor is meant to stay with the flock. A prophet can come to an assembly, minister to saints and leave afterwards, the same with an apostle but a pastor stays with the saints. He lives with the saints to make sure that what is being communicated to them is being carried out. They have a more detailed work, that is why they have so much attack from the saints they are pastoring than other ministries in the Body. A flock can prefer a ministry gift that visits than the pastor over him because of familiarity but as we grow up, we will understand that it is part of being childish or immature to do that. Some believers go as far as collecting the number of an itinerant minister and open up their lives to such a minister rather than their pastor. It is against New Testament ethics; even when you receive prayers and impartation from such mediums without the permission of your pastor, they will not work.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:250px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Ephesians 4:7-8 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t<ol start=\"7\">\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">These gifts are not referring to gift cards, they are men.

I believe every saint that got born again already has a pastor; there is someone Jesus has assigned to pastor him. Many believers may never meet their person God has set over them until they go to heaven. The Holy Ghost cannot get you born again and just leave you, He sets you in the Body and has assigned that you will be pastored but many people do not get to meet their pastors till they die. Who would give birth to a child and just leave them on the road? No sane person would do that, how much more the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost has plans of where you should be but some believers are rebels and will not allow the Holy Ghost to lead them to where they should be. Some, out of their own lusts and idols fall into the hands of hirelings.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">I have often wondered why people end up with hirelings but I understood when I read the story of a woman and it answered the question in my heart. The woman, while she was an unbeliever, had visited a church and when an altar call was made, she stepped out and got born again but as she sat back at her seat and the pastor continued teaching, the Holy Spirit told her that what that pastor was preaching was false. Jesus knows that there are hirelings in the Body, do you think He will get you born again and lead you to hirelings? For every believer that falls into the hands of hirelings, they have disobeyed the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost told that lady that even though that pastor led her to Christ, he was teaching a false doctrine. Most times, we play with nudges and witnesses in our hearts. Many who came to this local assembly for instance have a witness in their heart that this message is true.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">So also, you should be able to know when something is false. Many fall prey because they do not pay attention to that prompting. The first time I heard of a man who claimed to be a prophet in Nigeria (he is late now), I was born again but I was not so serious then. As I listened to him on television, I knew something was not right with that man. Then I wondered what had come over those seated in the church listening to him. If they are believers, they have lost touch with the nudgings of the Spirit in them, it is even possible that most of them are not born again; if you are born again, you would have a witness in your heart.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:246px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Ephesians 4:8-11 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t<ol start=\"8\">\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">These are the gifts.

If someone claims that he is a New Testament apostle, just check them and compare them with Apostle Paul; there are standards in scriptures. Paul was a New Testament apostle who was always going around establishing churches and breaking new grounds. Apostles, evangelists and those with teaching ministries in the Body move around but pastors stay with the flock. Every work that these ministry gifts are doing are supposed to be nurtured by pastors and if the pastoral team is not thorough, the work will be wasted because there will be no one making sure that the whole light is becoming a lifestyle.

They can reprove you by the teaching of the word or call you into their office to reprove you. The saints will not come into the place where they are beaten to shape. If these things are not handled, the saints will be lopsided; these are all part of the pastoral ministry.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Your pastor can call you and tell you what you should be doing, they can instruct you, that is their duty. While looking at this teaching I got to know that Satan has done a terrible work in the Body. When believers have been made smart, they are no longer sheep, they are no longer innocent. Satan knows that if you are not innocent and sheepish, there is no way the pastoral ministry can bless you. The pastor is a shepherd, he can only bless you when you are a sheep. You have to be sheepish, if you are not sheepish, you will be eluded.</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">The heads of most believers have become bigger than their hearts, so they find it difficult to trust oversights. We find it difficult to believe and be led because we have become too smart and our smartness is taking us away from God. We are no longer innocent and it has affected our attitude. May the Lord help us in Jesus&#39; name. The kinds of saints that are very common in the Body right now are beginning to morph into a kind of church that Jesus has not set. Saints are determining the church they want, the kind of pastor they want, how the church will look like; churches are even being designed to appeal to the smart minds of the saints. With that which the devil is communicating, you will not be able to partake of the blessing of the New Testament.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:252px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">2 Timothy 3:17 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"17\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">This kind of man of God being referred to here should not just be the preacher, he should also be a man of God.

Jesus has given pastors to feed and tend the flock, to nourish the sheep but you must be a sheep for those things to be a blessing to you. If you take another posture, it becomes difficult.

Sheep must be in folds. A fold is an enclosure for sheep; it is enclosed and you cannot just get access into it. If you enter through the window, you are a robber. In looking at the shepherd&rsquo;s tent, it has one door and if you don&#39;t have access to the door and you come in through the window, you are a thief and a robber who is accessing the sheep wrongly without going through the Lord who owns them.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:262px; margin-right:269px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">John 10:1-2 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t\t<ol>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ol>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:221px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">same is a thief and a robber.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li style=\"list-style-type:none\">\r\n\t\t<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ol>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">There is a right access to the sheep and that access is the door; Jesus must give you the right access to the sheepfold. A fold is an enclosure for the sheep. People who are into sheep grazing do not just scatter them anyhow, there is always a door and a fence erected. In this local church, there is a fence and a door in the spirit and the Lord Jesus Christ is the door. Some people like pastoring, they just love to have control over saints but those that are true shepherds don&#39;t even desire it.

You must be careful of thieves and robbers, they are always around sheep folds. There is a shepherd attached to a fold, it is always one shepherd to a fold; the fold in this context signifies local assemblies. Daddy and mummy are shepherds in this house while the associate pastors are bishops under them helping them to do the work, that is the way God set it. Another word for fold is families, local assemblies are families.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:262px; margin-right:269px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Psalms 68:6 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:109px; margin-right:90px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(6) God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:299px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">land.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">They want to bring a sheep into a fold. The rebellious are people who refuse this kind of leading to come into a fold, so they will not have access to refreshment, nourishment and growth, they will be stagnant in their growth. Have you seen some believers who, after 15 years of being a Christain, have become dry and stagnant. God wants to move sheep into folds because when sheep are in folds, His work over them will be made easier. God can easily access a sheep in a fold with meals for their growth than sheep outside the fold. God&#39;s desire is that sheep will be in folds, not that they should be scattered everywhere. He wants to gather the sheep but Satan wants to scatter them. God wants to gather sheep and put a shepherd over them.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">In the book of Revelation, the angels of the churches are the shepherds of those churches to take those letters, lights, instructions, and messages to them in their fold.

This should happen to every quickened believer, you must experience addition physically to a fold with a pastor as an oversight. There is a school of thought that says that all believers are brethren and are all the same, it does not work that way and is not a mindset in alignment with scriptures. In the early church where believers were gathering, Peter was the head and overseer there. When the Bible said that they sold their possession and put it at the apostle&rsquo;s feet, it meant Peter&rsquo;s feet, not all the apostles. The Bible often says: &quot;Peter and the eleven&quot; (cf. Acts 2:14, Matthew 10:2), which means Peter was the head. That means Jesus taught them well as their overseer. Even in an instance where Peter and John are mentioned, Peter is the one who always speaks. It was never recorded that John asked Peter to allow him to add to what Peter has spoken. Whatever Peter spoke was okay for the apostles because it was Peter that the Lord told to feed His sheep.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:268px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Acts 3:4-5 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<h3><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</span></em></h3>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:105px; margin-right:110px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(14) But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">So, even amongst the leadership of the early church (the twelve), Peter was the head. So when people say all believers are the same, they are deceiving themselves. Those disorderly thoughts are woven by evil spirits for people not to get blessed in a local assembly. Such a church will never prosper and heaven will not stamp it because it is not in order. Anything that is flowing according to order will keep going stronger and stronger. For instance, the house of David kept growing stronger while the house of Saul kept growing weaker. It was not that the house of David was fighting against the house of Saul, David was not fighting the house of Saul physically but because it was not in alignment with the Lord, it grew weaker. You don&rsquo;t need to fight anything false, all you need is to do the right thing and the false will go away by default; anything that will endure is that which is in alignment with God&rsquo;s will.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:262px; margin-right:269px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">1 John 2:17 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:170px; margin-right:91px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(17) And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">The world will pass away and anything that is not in line with the will is the world which will pass away.

That is why our Lord Jesus has found it difficult to lead friends to come under their friends as pastors because they are unable to follow with an open heart. But it should not be because you should have a pastor, and you are not the one to choose your pastor for yourself, so if the Lord says let your friend pastor you, there is something in it that you are not seeing. If you dislocate yourself and put yourself in some other places, you will not partake of the grace of the pastoral ministry even though you are a Christian. Christians that have not been pastored at all will trouble the church and their family; unpastored saints cannot raise children. As far as Jesus is concerned, He has given you a pastor He knows will help you grow up and will not give you another one because you refused the one He gave you; Jesus is tough. There are people that the Lord has told, about ten years ago, to move to a higher level but failed to respond; they will not grow. Do not allow age factors to stop you from enjoying pastoral ministry. Theologians say that Peter was older than Jesus and Jesus called him Satan and he was not offended. John the baptist really prepared the way, he prepared them. What is that thing that will stop you from accessing pastoral blessing? If you allow it, you will notice that you have cheated yourself when you cross to the other side, it is not even about the pastor.

There are a lot of deceptions and misguided teachings circulating in the body, that if you don&#39;t have a strong pastoral base, you will be moved.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Thank you for saying that the sheepfold is enclosed, no wise shepherd will allow the sheep to just be roaming as they like. When you see sheep feeding, they are being protected, they have overseers, they have those that God has anointed to oversee them. I was telling my wife yesterday that one of the blessings I enjoyed growing up was that I had strong pastors while growing up, and that will affect the texture of how your ministry will be.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">If you planned using the City Gate Church as IT for ministry I will disappoint you, you can&#39;t even survive it. If you enter a true new testament church it will be very clear if you have a calling. Many who thought they have calling never really had. Because you are a pastor in fellowship does not mean you are a pastor, that is why I don&#39;t call them pastor. When we were in school, our fellowship president, we used to call them &lsquo;brother&rsquo;. All these people that are called apostles today just finished school five years ago, six years ago. If you finish school as a pastor, join a church, carry speaker, prove your ministry.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">It is these boys that choose their spiritual fathers themselves, and the father they pick also were not also well pastored, they are also looking for sons, so many confusion, to get yourself in that is to get yourself in trouble.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">A true new testament church is actually a blessing, your primary blessing is attached there, God does not design it that you will be receiving from the internet. I am not against receiving itinerary ministries. EGFM is an itinerary ministry, God&rsquo;s servant is my spiritual servant and he is called to the larger body of Christ. Like an apostle is called to the larger body of Christ, pastors are sent to their local church. When saints are quickened in their spirit, they are sent to their local churches; pastors also connect ministries in the body that they work with to bless the saints. Don&rsquo;t just feed from everywhere, if you trust me as a Pastor let me know who you are listening to. Some of these men you can&#39;t trace their emergence, and you are opening yourself to</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">such men you are not wise, can you do that to your children? Can you feed them with Bukka food, morning, afternoon and night? Part of parenting is to know what your children need including their feeding. We have itinerary ministries that we work with, you know them, we bring them here every year, you can listen to them because theory is a consistent there is a consistent emphasis of the spirit that we are working with. If you are going to feed from a ministry through their books or tapes, let us know them. There are three levels of feeding: (1) your local church (2) itinerary ministries in the Body of Christ that are approved and tested to be pure. Don&rsquo;t open your soul to just anyone, there are lots of hirelings in the church. I am saying this with a very sorrowful heart, how I wish it was not like that, but Satan is doing his work, do not fall prey to such ministries. (3) your own personal bible study.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">When it comes to feeding it is very important.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">You must know how to connect with your pastor and receive grace from them. Your pastors are friendly but they are not your friend. If someone is your friend, he does not have to be your pastor, but if the Lord has chosen him to be your pastor, submit to them.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:9px\">What the Lord does is that he provides spiritual covering for pastors, and that covering is attached to feeding.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:262px; margin-right:269px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">Isaiah 4:5 KJV</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:97px; margin-right:104px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">(5) And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:281px\"><em><span style=\"color:#731b46\">a defence.</span></em></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">The Lord puts covering on the flock upon the lead shepherd as cloud and pillars wjich is an extension of providing sound doctrine for the people. No one knows the flock more than the shepherd that has oversight, even itinerary ministers have authority over the flock. If an itinerary minister gives you a prophecy, your pastor needs to scrutinize it and he is likely going to know. The pastor is a standing prophet, he may not be a prophet but he has prophetic dealings in his life else he cannot pastor flock.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px\">This church has gone through stages. I know of one minister that used to come then.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">There was a particular sister that kept meeting pastor, because she thinks my grace was shutting her down, so she went to be submitting to him. Of course she is not here</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">anymore, you cannot last in a local church that way. I believe primarily God sent her here, but like you said people enter into lesser purposes, she couldn&rsquo;t stay, she could not cope with the training, she could not discern the assembly, she taught our own is just perfection and perfection. Discernment is key, if you don&rsquo;t discern well, you won&rsquo;t maximize some grace. I even prefer people that leave physically, it makes you have a sense of responsibility that you need to get to somewhere else, but when you are in the place and you have disconnected, you can be like that for twenty years. I used to tell my wife that there is a brother that has been in a church for years and has not connected, of course he gets other benefits from the church like business connection but the main reason he was sent there, he is not benefiting from it, and the pastor of that church is one of the best teachers I know in the body today.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">All the five fold ministry gifts are shepherdic, a prophet is shepherdic, even though he is not a pastor, he will not take you out of the church, many people called prophets are really not prophets, they have anointings that have been perverted by spirits, the prophetic is one of the most volatile gifts in the body, and are most prone to deception. You will hardly hear of false pastors, you can see an hireling but in the scriptures false prophets stand out. False prophets begin it, while false teachers establish what they start. We need to teach the purity of prophetic ministry. All of them are shepherdic not all will have a pastoral calling to lead a local church.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Because you are traveling does not make you an apostle. Some people don&#39;t move so much but they are apostles. What makes you an apostle is by calling and by office, it is not by traveling. You can be a traveling evangelist or teacher but that does not call you into the office of an apostle. There are apostles that don&rsquo;t travel so much. History did not tell us that John traveled so much, but he was an apostle, traveling is not the measurement. Some people turn to apostles overnight because they are moving from place to place, but they don&rsquo;t have apostolic things following them.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">An apostle should be accountable to a pastor. There is no such thing as an apostle overseeing everybody that does not have a pastor. Paul had a base, he had guys that could speak to his life also. There is a system of government in the church that must be recovered,</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Don&#39;t be semi-planted in a local church, be fully planted. Be careful of those semi-planted, don&#39;t be close to those that are semi-planted, stay away from them, I am saying it on the pulpit now. Someone can be in the church and is planning to go and open his own church, he knows what he wants to do already. The person catches</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">you as a potential church member. If God would send Him to pastor you, it is not in that church. God is not an author of confusion.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">If I hear about any break away school, I don&#39;t take my children into such school because it is a rebel school. Let them have everything, I won&rsquo;t send my children there. Do you know that the school you send your children to matters? It is possible that spirits are in the school, some teachers have caused heartache for some school owners, overnight they take students aways from the school, overnight students are gone. Same with church also, half of the church can be taken by sowing seeds.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:8px\">Don&#39;t be semi-planted, decide; don&#39;t be 50% in: be 100%! It is either you are not in or you are in. If you see some people in and out don&rsquo;t be close to them. Most of them have issues in their life, some people will never submit to church because of terrible things Satan has done in them, they will go to heaven like that, some of them will be pastored in the world to come whether they like it or not because the things that have shaped them wrongly will be taken away, it is a major veil. I heard a story of someone that struggled with church, he moved from church to church, currently his life is messed up.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"margin-left:7px; margin-right:9px\">God has a wisdom, you are a sheep, that is how God made us, and sheep are designed to flock together, anything outside that is anti our nature in the New Testament.</h3>",
